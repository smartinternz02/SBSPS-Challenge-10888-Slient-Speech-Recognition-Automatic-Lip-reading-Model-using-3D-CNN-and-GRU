text = "We employ the GRID corpus for training due to its sentence-level nature and extensive dataset. " \
       "The sentences are structured using a straightforward grammar pattern: command(4) + color(4) + " \
       "preposition(4) + letter(25) + digit(10) + adverb(4). Each number indicates the available word " \
       "choices within the corresponding word category. These categories encompass {bin, lay, place, set}, " \
       "{blue, green, red, white}, {at, by, in, with}, {A,...,Z}{W}, {zero, ..., nine}, and " \
       "{again, now, please, soon}, resulting in a pool of 64,000 potential sentences. For instance, " \
       "exemplars from this dataset include 'set blue by A four please' and 'place red at C zero again'. " \
       "Model training was conducted on the first 450 videos of speaker one."
